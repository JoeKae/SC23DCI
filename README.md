# SC23DCI
SC23DCI AC MQTT agent
Works with Devices like this one: https://www.frico.net/fileadmin/user_upload/frico/Pdf/cat_frico_soloclim_de.pdf

## Setup

### Activate Wi-Fi

While the A/C is running, long press the power icon on the display. After a few seconds you can cycle 
through ```[on, rst, off]``` by tapping the power icon. This sets Wi-Fi on/off or resets the WiFi-Config.
When the display shows the desired value, wait a few seconds and the setting is saved.

Entering this menu can be a bit tedious because the A/C tends to just turn off when the power icon is pressed.
You can try this:
Turn the A/C off, then double tap the power icon and do not lift your finger on the second tap.
I think it takes ~5 seconds until the menu appears. 

If you were successful, the A/C will create a WLAN, through which it can be configured using the [app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=it.kumbe.innovapp20) 
and can be integrated into your WLAN.
